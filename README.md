# Nitrate Levels and Cancer Rates in Wisconsin: A Spatial Analysis

This repository contains a Python script used for spatial analysis of nitrate levels and cancer rates in Wisconsin. This project was completed as part of a graduate-level course with the Geography Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the spatial relationship between nitrate levels and cancer rates across Wisconsin. The project leverages ArcGIS Pro and Python to execute various spatial analysis techniques, including Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, and Moran's I statistic for spatial autocorrelation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- ArcGIS Pro
- ArcPy
- Tkinter

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure to install the required modules: `arcpy`, `Tkinter`, `PIL`.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Set your working directory to where the script is located.
4. Run the script.

## Files in this Repository

- `YourScriptName.py`: The main Python script for the analysis.
